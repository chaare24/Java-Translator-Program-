Note:

Parser.java - the error message of a terminal with multiple starting token will use the first definite starting token.
		Example of definite starting token:
			ref_id ::= ['~' [number]] id

			!mustbe(ref_id) will show "mustbe: want TOK.ID" becuase it is the first definite starting token.

		Another Example: 
			statement ::= assignment | print | do | if
			assignment ::= ref_id '=' expr
		    	
			!mustbe(statement) will show "mustbe: want TOK.ID" because assignment -> ref_id -> id.

Results:

We were able to successfully complete all of the test cases.
